## Continuum Effects in Breakup Reactions 

In principle, there are different ways to compute the elastic breakup observables. For example, in the IAV model, one has 
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{d^2 \sigma}{dE_b d\Omega_b} \Big |_\mathrm{EBU} = \frac{2\pi}{\hbar v_a} \rho_b(E_b) \rho_x(E_x) \frac{1}{2j_a+1}\frac{1}{2s_A+1}\sum_{m_a}\sum_{m_A}\sum_{m_b}\sum_{m_x}\int \Big|\langle  \chi_x^{(-)m_x, m_A} (\vec{k}_x) | \rho^{m_b,j_\mathrm{in}}(\vec{k}_b) \rangle \Big|^2 d\Omega_x.
\end{align}
$$
where 
$$
\begin{align}
\langle r_x \gamma | \rho^{m_b,j_\mathrm{in}} (\vec{k}_b)  \rangle = &\sum_{\alpha_\mathrm{out}} \int dr_b r_b^2 \langle r_x \gamma \chi_b^{m_b(-)} (\vec{k}_b)| r_x r_b \alpha_\mathrm{out} \rangle \sum_{\alpha_\mathrm{cdcc}}\int_{-1}^{1} dx V_\mathrm{post} (r_x,r_b,x,\alpha_\mathrm{cdcc})\mathcal{G}^{\mathrm{out}\gets \mathrm{in}}_{\alpha_\mathrm{cdcc},\alpha_\mathrm{out}}(r_xr_bx)  \nonumber \\ 
& \times \langle r_{bx}r_a \alpha_\mathrm{cdcc} | \Psi^{j_\mathrm{in}(+)}  \rangle,
\end{align}
$$
In this case, the continuum effects of the CDCC wave function act as a whole, then transfer to the $b+(x+A)$ Jacobi system. There are interference terms between different bin states in the continuum.

On the other hand, when we consider computing the elastic breakup observables in the prior form, such as Eq.(19) of the supplementary materials, one has 
$$
\begin{align}
\sigma(\beta n) =& \int \frac{d\sigma(\beta n)}{d\Omega_k} d\Omega_k =\frac{1}{2j_a+1} \frac{1}{2j_A+1} \frac{\mu_{(bx)A}^2}{\hbar^4}\frac{2^4\pi}{K_0^3K} \sum_{\tilde{\alpha}\tilde{\alpha}'}\sum_{\tilde{\alpha}_0} \nonumber \\
& \times \left|\int dR\  u_{\tilde{\alpha},\tilde{\alpha}}(R)\left(U_{\tilde{\alpha},\tilde{\alpha}'}(R)-\tilde{U}_{\tilde{\alpha},\tilde{\alpha}}(R)\delta_{\tilde{\alpha},\tilde{\alpha}'}\right) u_{\tilde{\alpha}' \tilde{\alpha}_0}(R)  \right|^2.
\end{align}
$$
In this case, as you can see, the sum of different continuum bin states is outside the modulus square, so there is no interference between different continuum states.

For instance, I plot the CDCC wave function, comparing different quantities.

In this figure, the modulus squared of the scattering wave function is shown:

1. **g.s.** is the result of $|u_{\tilde{\alpha}_0 \tilde{\alpha}_0}(R)|^2$.
2. **CC1** is the result of $|\sum_{\tilde{\alpha}'=1}^n u_{\tilde{\alpha}' \tilde{\alpha}_0}(R)|^2$, where the sum of the scattering wave functions is computed before taking the modulus squared.
3. **CC2** is the result of $\sum_{\tilde{\alpha}'=1}^n |u_{\tilde{\alpha}' \tilde{\alpha}_0}(R)|^2$, which is the sum of the modulus squared of each continuum state scattering wave function.

CC1 reflects the IAV form, and CC2 reflects the CDCC-prior form. However, in both cases, the effects of continuum states are small compared to the ground states.
