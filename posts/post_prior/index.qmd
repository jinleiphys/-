After discussing with Junzhe and consulting Dr. Rimantas Lazauskas, I concluded that the post-prior equivalence in the EBU with the T-matrix form is not valid. I will address this issue from two perspectives: the $S$-matrix derived from the inhomogeneous equations and the T-matrix form.

## $S$-matrix from Inhomogeneous Equations

The key equation of the IAV model is given by:
$$
[E_x - T_x - U_x] \psi^{(+)}_x(\vec{r}_x) = \rho(\vec{r}_x)
$$

In the post-form representation, due to the lack of a natural cutoff on the $r_x$ variable, $\rho(\vec{r}_x)$ behaves as $O(1/r^2)$ for $r_x \to \infty$. This behavior implies that $\rho(\vec{r}_x)$ is not square-integrable, meaning the $S$-matrix is not well-defined. Specifically, in the partial wave basis, the equation can be rewritten as:
$$
\left\{\frac{\hbar^2}{2\mu_x}\left[\frac{d^2}{dr_x^2} - \frac{l_x(l_x+1)}{r_x^2}\right] + E_x - U_x(r_x)\right\} u_\alpha(r_x) = r\rho_\alpha(r_x)
$$
where $\alpha$ is the channel index. Generally, the asymptotic behavior of $u_\alpha(r_x)$ is:
$$
u_\alpha(r_x) \to -SH_l^{(+)} \quad \text{as} \quad r_x \to \infty
$$

However, as pointed out by Rimas, if the source term $r\rho_\alpha(r_x)$ is not compact and behaves as $O(1/r)$, the boundary condition of $u_\alpha(r_x)$ cannot follow the above form. The reason is that the general solution for a second-order differential equation is a linear combination of two independent solutions, $u(r_x) = A(r_x) + A_0(r_x)$, where:
$$
(E + \frac{d^2}{dr^2})A_0(r) = 0
$$
and
$$
A(r) = \int \left(\int (f(r) - E) \, dr\right) \, dr
$$

Here, $A_0(r)$ is the general solution and can have an outgoing wave form. However, the drift term $A(r)$ is asymptotically divergent. Assuming the asymptotic behavior of $f(r)$ is $O(1/r)$, then:
$$
A(r) \to \int \left(\int \left(\frac{1}{r} - E\right) \, dr\right) \, dr \to \int (\ln(r)) \, dr \to r \ln |r| - r
$$

This divergence highlights the challenges in defining the boundary conditions and the $S$-matrix for such systems.

On the other hand, as Junzhe pointed out, the Hankel function $ H_l^{(+)} $ satisfies the following differential equation:
$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 f}{\mathrm{d} x^2} + \left(1 - \frac{2 \eta}{x} - \frac{\lambda(\lambda+1)}{x^2}\right) f(x) = 0
$$
However, if the source term behaves as $O(1/r)$ and we assume the asymptotic behavior of $u_\alpha(r_x) \to -SH^{(+)}_l(r_x)$, then $H^{(+)}_l(r_x)$ will not satisfy the original equation. Instead, the equation becomes:
$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 f}{\mathrm{d} x^2} + \left(1 - \frac{2 \eta}{x} - \frac{\lambda(\lambda+1)}{x^2}\right) f(x) = \frac{1}{x}
$$
This discrepancy indicates that the presence of the $O(1/r)$ source term modifies the differential equation, meaning $H^{(+)}_l(r_x)$ is no longer a valid solution under these conditions. This highlights the need for a different approach to account for the modified source term and its impact on the solution's asymptotic behavior.
